## Montecito, California

Fausto Tasca designed numerous room interiors for clients in Montecito. At the time, Italianate styles were very popular with the wealthy of that area. Tasca was hired to develop and execute various interpretations of “Italian” room interiors.

In order to present his ideas to clients, Tasca created many concept drawings which detailed his vision for the final appearance of each project. These designs frequently included furniture as well as fireplaces and window treatments.

Information regarding Tasca’s commissioned decorative painting for estate homes in Montecito and Santa Barbara would be greatly appreciated. Please contact [tascafineart@gmail.com](mailto:tascafineart@gmail.com).
