Upon arrival in the United States, Fausto Tasca and his new bride settled for about eighteen months in New York city, where their only child was born. After several difficult months in Mingus, Texas, the family moved to Santa Barbara, California. Tascaâ€™s first known commissions while living in Santa Barbara were the design and execution of interior decorative work for several estate homes in [Montecito](/montecito.html).

It is also known that while living in Santa Barbara, Tasca painted scenic backdrops for various plays and theater projects. He also painted portraits and other figurative studies for use at the annual celebration, now called The Fiesta in Santa Barbara.

Fausto Tasca was awarded a commission from the City of Santa Barbara to paint a landscape featuring the facade of the Mission Santa Barbara. This painting was presented by city representatives to the King and Queen of Belgium at the end of a state visit to California.
