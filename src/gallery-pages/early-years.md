## Early Years

Art academy studies in Bassano and Venice, 1905&#8211;1913

Fausto Tasca first studied art formally at a special school of design in the nearby town of Bassano del Grappa. A local benefactor, recognizing Tasca’s talent, sponsored these studies.

Several years later, Tasca gained entrance to the prestigious Royal Institute of Fine Arts in Venice where he earned several prizes for landscape and seascape paintings. Because his work showed exceptional promise, Tasca’s studies in Venice were again sponsored by the same benefactor who had funded his studies at the smaller school of design in Bassano del Grappa.

Tasca’s studies at the Academy in Venice were interrupted by obligatory military service. After his military service, Tasca lived briefly in Rome where he worked as a portraitist, then returned to Venice before marrying and emigrating to the United States with his new bride in 1913.
