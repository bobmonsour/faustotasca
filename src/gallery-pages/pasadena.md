### Saint Andrew's Church

Fausto Tasca worked with friend and professional colleague, Carlo Wostry, at Saint Andrew’s Church in Pasadena, California. According to Tasca’s son, who also worked as an apprentice on this commission, Wostry realized that the Saint Andrew’s commission was too complex for him to complete alone within the alloted time, so he shared the commission with Fausto Tasca.

At Saint Andrew’s, Tasca decorated the beamed ceiling of the church’s nave with colorful graphic and animal motifs.

Tasca also decorated the foyer, painting it from floor to ceiling. The lower portion of each wall was painted with trompe d’oeil bronze shields against a vermillion ground, the upper portion of the walls was painted to resemble marble. The ceiling has an intricate flower-and-angel motif which stands on a gold leaf background. This motif is subdivided by a simple design consisting of “rope” and graphic flowers painted in light blue, white and vermillion.

Unfortunately, the walls of the foyer were badly damaged in the late 1970s when they were covered with wallpaper. Although they have been “restored”, they now show little of their former finesse.
