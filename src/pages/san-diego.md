## San Diego, California

### Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church

The parish church located near the corner of State and Date Streets in San Diego’s Little Italy is affectionately known as The Church of the Fishermen. The Italian fishermen who once lived in the area wanted to have a beautiful church that would remind them of their beloved homeland. They rallied together and collected enough money to raise and decorate their church. The church itself was the vision of Father Rabagliati, whose dedication and spirit were key to bringing the church to life.

To this day, the Church of the Fishermen is considered the “Jewel of Little Italy.” [link to restoration video] The construction of the church began on August 17, 1923 and was completed in time for the church to be blessed on Christmas Eve 1923. [https:// www.olrsd.org/]

Fausto Tasca won the commission to decorate the entire interior of the church. His plan was ambitious. It included two huge murals, several ceiling medallions, and grisailles of cherubs and angels. It also included the design and execution of all the stained glass windows in the church. In spite of the enormous amount of work needed to complete the decoration of the church, Fausto completed all the work in time for the church dedication on November 15, 1925 — in under two years.

The well-known sculptor and close friend of Fausto, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Romanelli" target="_blank">Carlo Romanelli</a>, received the commission to sculpt states of the Sacred Heart and the Blessed Virgin. Fausto painted both statues in a realistic style. The two statues still occupy niches to the left and right of the main altar.

All the large paintings for Our Lady of the Rosary were completed in Fausto’s studio. The largest of the paintings, The Crucifixion and The Last Judgment, were painted on huge sheets of canvas. When they were complete, he transported them by train to San Diego, and installed them in the church. Fausto had perfected a special glue, suited to the dry climate of California, to apply the canvas to the stucco walls of the church.

Our Lady of the Rosary Church, still much beloved by the community, underwent a beautiful restoration recently and reopened for Mass in 2021.

A history of the first 90 years of the church <a href="https://www.olrsd.org/History-of-OLR" target="_blank">can be found here</a>. It illuminates the goals of the artwork to be commissioned for this new church in the 1920s as noted in this excerpt:

<p class="blkquote">The structure in place, there now remained the work of completing the interior of the church. Father Rabagliati was hopeful of finding the finest artists available to do the religious interior décor so that his church would be in keeping with the artistic traditions of the churches in Italy. Sensitive to the needs of his people, he realized how important it was to create a familiar environment for them in this new land. It was his hope that, with this feeling of “home,” there would also be a renewal of their Faith and love of God. Father Rabagliati’s design for the interior would be one that would be appreciated not only for its aesthetic appeal, but far more importantly, as a spiritual aid in lifting the thoughts of men to prayerful reflection on the teachings of the Faith. To accomplish this work, Rabagliati contacted a famous Venetian painter, Fausto Tasca, then living in southern California, as well as a renowned Italian sculptor, Carlo Romanelli.</p>

In 2010, a brief documentary of the church was created, highlighting its history and describing the artwork.
