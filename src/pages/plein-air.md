## Plein Air

Fausto loved painting outside, <span class="ital">en plein air</span>. He started working in this manner while a student in Italy and continued to paint outdoors all his life. The paintings in this gallery are all small, they measure 5.5 x 8.6” (14 x 22 cm). Most of them were painted on wood panel, some were painted on canvas. All are in oil.

He called these paintings “oil sketches.” While painting outdoors, he worked <span class="ital">alla prima</span>, that is to say, quickly and with virtually no corrections or changes once a mark was made. According to his son, the sketches took very little time to execute — apparently only five to ten minutes.
