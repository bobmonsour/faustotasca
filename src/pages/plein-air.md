Fausto loved painting outside, en plein air. He started working in this manner while a student in Italy and continued to paint outdoors all his life. The paintings in this gallery are all small, they measure 5.5 x 8.6” (14 x 22 cm). Most of them were painted on wood panel, some were painted on canvas. All are in oil.

He called these paintings “oil sketches.” While painting outdoors, he worked alla prima, that is to say, quickly and with virtually no corrections or changes once a mark was made. According to his son, the sketches took very little time to execute — apparently only five to ten minutes.
