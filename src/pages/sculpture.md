## Sculpture

Fausto Tasca made many sculpture studies, or maquettes, but few known finished pieces. His portrait bust of the great Enrico Caruso is one of his few finished sculptures in existence. The large bust of Caruso, pictured here, was created as a gift for the great tenorâ€™s family.

In addition to the large bust of Caruso, Tasca sculpted a smaller version of the bust. From this smaller original he cast many copies, which he painted to simulate bronze and sold. It is not known how many of these smaller busts are still in circulation.

Maquettes, or studies for commissioned work:
