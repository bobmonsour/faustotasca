## Sculpture

Fausto Tasca made many studies, or maquettes, but few known finished sculptures. His portrait bust of the great Enrico Caruso is one of the few large-scale sculptures in existence. The large bust of Caruso, pictured here, was created as a gift for the great tenorâ€™s family. A copy of this work is in the collection of the Tasca family.

In addition to the large bust of Caruso, Tasca sculpted a smaller version of the bust. From this smaller original he cast many copies, which he painted to simulate bronze and sold. It is not known how many of these smaller busts are still in circulation.
