## Heading West

Upon their arrival in the United State, Fausto and Paolina settled in the Bronx where their only child, Angelo, was born. As neither of them spoke any English, their movements were largely restricted to the community of Italian immigrants.

On the advice of a family member who had left New York for the West, the family relocated to Mingus, Texas.

In Mingus, Fausto found some work painting signage and doing fancy lettering for storefronts. However, this rather limited work could not support his family, so he resorted to working in the coal mines.

The same family member who suggested moving to Texas, now suggested continuing westward to Santa Barbara. The physical beauty of the American Riviera, the temperate climate, and the cultural mileau of Santa Barbara were all very appealing to the young family.

Fausto and Paolina both offered their artistic talents to the annual Fiesta in Santa Barbara. Paolina was a gifted singer, and Fausto painted scenic backdrops and narrative banners for the Fiesta events. He also painted background for plays and other theatre presentations.

In 1919 Fausto received the commission from the City of Santa Barbara to paint a gift for the King and Queen of Belgium. The royal couple would visit Santa Barbara that year, and the city very much wanted to present them with a beautiful landscape featuring the Mission.
