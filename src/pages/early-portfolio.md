## Early Portfolio

A gallery of Fausto Tascaâ€™s early work. Unfortunately, Tasca did not date his work, neither did he indicate where the work was done. However, some of the images themselves provide evidence of location. For example, the oil sketch was probably painted en plein air in Venice. The watercolor painting of an elaborate fireplace surround was done inside the Palazzo Ducale in Venice.
