## Early Portfolio

The images that follow are a sample of Fausto Tasca’s early work. Fausto was not in the habit of dating his work, neither did he indicate where a work was done. However, some of the images themselves provide evidence of date and/or location. For example, the conte crayon sketch was probably done <span class="ital">en plein air</span> in the countryside surrounding Venice. That would put this particular sketch during his years of study in Venice, 1904&#8211;1906. The watercolor painting of an elaborate fireplace surround was done inside the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, and can be dated to roughly the same period.
