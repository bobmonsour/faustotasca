## Pasadena, California

<span class="intro">Saint Andrew Church </span>Fausto Tasca worked with friend and professional colleague, Carlo Wostry, at Saint Andrew Church in Pasadena, California. According to Fausto’s son, who also worked as an apprentice on this commission, Wostry realized that the Saint Andrew commission was too complex for him to complete within the timeline allowed by the project, so with a gentleman’s handshake, he hired Fausto to undertake specific sections of the church interior.

Tasca also designed and executed the foyer decoration, painting it from floor to ceiling. In this installation, Fausto painted directly on the walls instead of on canvas, as he had done at Our Lady of the Rosary.

The lower portion of each wall was painted with <span class="ital">trompe d’oeil</span> bronze shields against a vermillion ground, the upper portion of the walls was carefully painted to resemble marble. The complex shape of the foyer ceiling was beautifully painted with flower garlands and angels, on a gold-leaf background.

Unfortunately, the walls of the foyer were badly damaged in the late 1970s when they were covered with wallpaper. The administration of the church at the time believed the walls were “too dirty” and did not think they could be properly cleaned. Although the walls have been “restored,” the marbled appearance of the painting was lost.

Today, the beauty and historical importance of <a href="https://www.saintandrewpasadena.org/" target="_blank">St. Andrew Church</a> has finally been recognized. The parish now includes a “restoration committee” to maintain this important landmark.
