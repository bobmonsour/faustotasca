## Los Angeles, California

### Citizen's National Trust & Savings
### Farmers and Merchants Bank
### Cabrini Chapel

Tasca received a significant commission to decorate the interior of the Citizen’s National Trust & Savings Bank in Los Angeles. His design, possibly dictated by the client, or possibly based on his experiences in Santa Barbara, used early California settlers as its theme. Tasca’s execution of this commission included ceiling medallions and small murals. Tasca painted at least eight small scenes and several larger ceiling medallions. It is not known if he was responsible for the stained glass windows in this building.

For the Citizen’s National commission, Tasca painted all his work on canvas and applied the canvas to the walls using a special glue he had developed. This method permitted him to complete his painting in the relative comfort of his studio, and then install the works after they were complete. This method also gave him the advantage of being able to remove the paintings in the case the building was later renovated or demolished.

The bank building, formerly located at 736 South Hill Street in Los Angeles, was demolished in the mid&#8211;1970s to make way for a parking lot. Fausto Tasca’s paintings were all removed by an art lover, and have since been recovered by the Tasca family.
