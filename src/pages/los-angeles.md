Citizen’s National Trust and Savings Farmers and Merchants Bank Cabrini Chapel

In 1920-1921, Fausto worked on the important commission to decorate the interior of the Citizen’s National Trust and Savings at 736 Hill Street in Los Angeles. Another local artist, Hernando Gonzallo Villa, [https://collections.lacma.org/node/166797] also worked on this project. Villa painted a mural for the west wall of the bank.

Fausto’s design for the bank interior was based on a history of the west written by O.E. Monnette, Chronology of California. [wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Fausto_Bellino_Tasca] This commission included a series of thirteen narrative murals and two large ceiling medallions, “Allegory of Intustry” and “Triumph of California.”

All the paintings for this commission were created on canvas and attached to the walls of the bank interior using special glue. The narrative murals follow the story of California history, and include Drake’s Landing, Spanish settlers, a Prospector, Cowboys, as well as a California Indian scout. Fausto carefully researched the appearance of each of his subjects, and did his best to portray each with respect and realism.

In the mid-1970’s this extraordinary bank was demolished to make way for a parking lot. By chance, an art lover knew of Fausto’s method of applying his painting to the walls, stepped in to rescue the paintings. All the works were kept in storage until 2018, when a descendent of the developer who razed the bank contacted the painter’s granddaughter. The two families negotiated, and the paintings were recovered by the Tasca family. The Tasca family is now negotiating with museums in California to restore and display these beautiful works.

Although the Redondo Beach branch of the Farmers and Merchants bank still stands at the location indicated by 1915 photographs, the bank building no longer exists. Photographs of the current Farmers and Merchants Bank located at 1333 Pacific Coast Highway is slick and modern, and give no indication of the bank’s origins or history. Sadly, the mural by Fausto Tasca has also disappeared.

Cabrini Chapel

Fausto Tasca designed and decorated the interior spaces of the chapel for Villa Cabrini. Sadly, the chapel was razed, the property sold. the only traces of Fausto’s original work for the chapel are located in the tasca Family Archives.
